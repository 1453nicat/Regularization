# Regularization
Ridge-Lasso-ElasticNet

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding additional constraints or penalties to the model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns not just the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise or random fluctuations, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.
